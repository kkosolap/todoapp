# todoapp
### An End-To-End REST API web application that allows users to create and modify to-do lists. Hosted on AWS Cloud services and data stored in an AWS RDS. 

This was a quick and simple way for me to begin self-learning REST API web development this past summer. I learned how to write GET/POST/DELETE API routes and how to manage data stored in a MySQL Amazon RDS. If you would like to clone this repository and try it out yourself, don't forget to set up a MySQL database with a lists table and a items table as well as npm install to download all the node_modules necessary to run the project.
